# Implementation of Shell
This is the implentation of a command line interpreter, or shell, on top of Unix. There are several features:  
a): Interactive and Batch  
In interactive mode, the user of the shell will type in a command at the prompt.  
n batch mode, the shell is started by specifying a batch file on its command line; the batch file contains the list of commands (each on its own line) that should be executed.
