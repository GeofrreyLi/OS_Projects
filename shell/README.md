# Implementation of Shell
This is the implentation of a command line interpreter, or shell, on top of Unix. There are several features:  
a): Interactive and Batch  
In interactive mode, the user of the shell will type in a command at the prompt.  
n batch mode, the shell is started by specifying a batch file on its command line; the batch file contains the list of commands (each on its own line) that should be executed.
b):  Redirection  
The shell user prefers to send the output of a program to a file rather than to the screen. Usually, a shell redirects standout output to a file with the > character.
c): Aliases
An alias is just a short-cut so that the user can type in something simple and have something more complex (or more safe) be executed.
