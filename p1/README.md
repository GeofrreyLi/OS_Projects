# 1. my-look
The program my-look is a simple program based on the utility look. On UNIX systems, the best way to read about utilities and functions is to use what are called the man pages (short for manual). In our HTML/web-driven world, the man pages feel a bit antiquated, but they are useful and informative and generally quite easy to use.
a). To access the man page for look, for example, just type the following at your UNIX shell prompt: prompt> man look
b). A typical usage if you would like to find a list of words that start with "gn" would be: prompt> ./my-look -f /usr/share/dict/words gn
